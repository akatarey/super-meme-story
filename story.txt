There was man named Rob in the town of Greenbrook.

Rob was a mischevious yet intelligent man, often time robbing the bank without being caught.

One day he was walking across a bridge on an especially windy day, when a 
genie approached him from the river below. When it asked what he wanted, he
said, "I want unlimited wishes!". And so the Genie said, "very well, you will
have them.". Thus they stood there for many more windy days to come.
