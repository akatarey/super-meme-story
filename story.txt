There was man named Rob in the town of Greenbrook.

Rob was a mischevious yet intelligent man, often time robbing the bank without being caught.

One day he was walking across a bridge on an especially windy day, when a 
genie approached him from the river below. When it asked what he wanted, he
said, "I want unlimited wishes!". And so the Genie said, "very well, you will
have them.". Thus they stood there for many more windy days to come.

Rob became wealthy and got pretty much everything that he wanted. He no longer needed to
rob the bank anymore or any other mischevious crimes. As an wealthy man, he started to 
give away his money to charities. But as an mischevious and intelligent man, he still
wanted to create some mischief, as mischevious is part of his whole being. He began to 
think of some ideas. Something finally came to mind...

Finally, Rob had the perfect idea: play elaborate pranks on other people! This way, not only could Rob still express
his mischievous side, he could pay for any damages done to other people. Soon, Rob lived a happy life as a the wealthiest
prankster in the town of Greenbrook.
